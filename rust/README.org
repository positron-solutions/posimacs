* Rust
  Default versions of Rust tools useful for bootstrapping or for use with
  non-nixified Rust projects and projects that choose to rely on the floating
  versions here rather than pinning their own versions.

  If a project does at some point need a specific version, don't roll back these
  versions.  Pin your project's versions instead.
** Tools Included
   - ~cargo2nix~ nixifier for Rust projects
   - ~rust~ A working cargo & rustc
*** Options

    Configure your preferred Rust version by setting the following option in
    your ~home.nix~

    #+BEGIN_SRC nix
    posimacs = {
      rust-channel = "stable";
      # rust-cahnnel = "nightly";
      # rust-channel = "1.44.1";
    };
    #+END_SRC


** Installation & Configuration
   You should have home manager installed using the instructions at the root of
   this repository.

   #+BEGIN_SRC nix
     { pkgs, ... }:

     let
       # assuming you use niv to manage your posimacs version pins
       # sources = import ./nix/sources.nix;
       # posimacs-rust = import "${sources.posimacs}/rust";

       # the recommended way of local development, a path literal pointing to a
       # checked out copy of this repository
       posimacs-rust = ~/my/checked/out/copy/posimacs/rust;
     in
       imports = [
         posimacs-rust
       ];
     }
   #+END_SRC
