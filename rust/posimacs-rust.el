;; Rust support

;;; Code:

;; Tree sitter support is installed ðŸ˜€
;; TODO This lisp is dependent upon Emacs being installed with tree sitter
;; support, which is in ../posimacs.nix
;; It is a dependency, and stating it within the Rust module would require some
;; option support, from the top-level module, and modules add complexity...
;; Possibly we can configure Emacs to load the tree sitter grammars without
;; having them in the Emacs derivation itself.
