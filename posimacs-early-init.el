;;; posimacs-early-init.el --- standard speedups & bootstrap -*-lexical-binding: t-*-

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Tricks to speed up loading and avoid unwanted work & initialization that
;; would affect downstream init.
;;
;; Don't draw things on startup that would be turned off later (toobars etc).
;;
;; Remove graphical flickers and set up some colors that will mesh better with
;; the actual theme loading or at least not blind us when the config has a bug.
;;
;; Variables that are particular to Emacs being installed via Nix.

;;; Code:

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil) ; prevent package.el so we can use elpaca

;; Every file opened and loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for
;; a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it wonâ€™t need any of them.
;; This is reset in posimacs-init.el after `elpaca-after-init-hook' it is reset
;; to the original value.

;; Note, `gcmh' package will modify this later, so we don't reset it.
