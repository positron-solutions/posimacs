* Nixified Rust Analyzer
  - This package is set up to just work, but updating the version is not yet as
    easy as =niv update=
  - In order for you repo to operate properly with direnv, you will need the
    =rust-src= package in your shell.  Cargo2nix has a complete example in its
    shell setup, but here's the snippet:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
  shell = pkgs.mkShell {
    inputsFrom = pkgs.lib.mapAttrsToList (_: pkg: pkg { }) rustPkgs.noBuild.workspace;
    nativeBuildInputs = with rustPkgs; [ cargo rustc rust-src ];

    # This line adds RUST_SRC_PATH to the environment so that, via direnv
    # integration, your Rust Analyzer binary will begin using the correct rust
    # source
    RUST_SRC_PATH = "${rustPkgs.rust-src}/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library";
  };
#+END_SRC
** Updating Rust Analyzer Version
  - Cargo2nix generates a Cargo.nix that, together with the Cargo2nix overlay,
    are a reproducible build of Rust Analyzer
*** Re-Freezing Cargo.nix
  1. Download Rust Analyzer source
  2. Load a nix-shell with bleeding edge Cargo2nix (0.9+)
  3. Nixify as usual
  6. Copy this modified Cargo.nix into this module and **update the
     rust-analyzer source rev**
