* Nixified Rust Analyzer
  - This package is set up to just work, but updating the version is not yet as
    easy as =niv update=
  - In order for you repo to operate properly with direnv, you will need the
    =rust-src= package in your shell.  Search a working repo for =rust-src= in
    the nix files to see how.
** Updating Rust Analyzer Version
  - To avoid vendoring the Rust Analyzer source and until Cargo2nix better
    supports this use case, the Cargo.nix shipped here is a custom freeze.
*** Re-Freezing Cargo.nix
  1. Download Rust Analyzer source
  2. Load a nix-shell with bleeding edge Cargo2nix
  3. Nixify as usual
  4. Modify Cargo.nix to accept a =workspaceSrc= argument
  5. Modify paths in Cargo.nix to consume your provided source directly, not using =fetchCrateLocal=
     =src = "${workspaceSrc}/crates/ra_flycheck";=
     - use the expression: =src = fetchCrateLocal .\\([a-zA-Z-_/]+\\)/.=
     - and replace with =src = "${workspaceSrc}\1"=
  6. Copy this modified Cargo.nix into this module and **update the rust-analyzer source rev**
     =niv update rust-analyzer --attribute rev=shAkzkAhuiakjadfklAkljasfklj=
