;;; posimacs-terminal --- Running Normal Things

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; To do more in Emacs, it is convenient to be able to lean back on external
;; CLI's without frontends or unfamiliar shells with limitations such as eshell.
;; Vterm is adopted as the standard way to open a shell in this configuration.
;;

;;; Code:


(use-package vterm
   :load-path  "~/.emacs.d/vendor/emacs-vterm")


;;; posimacs-terminal ends here
